Place your TensorFlow Lite model in this directory and name it effect_model.tflite.
A default sample model is bundled as effect_model.tflite so the template runs without extra setup; replace it with your own when you're ready.
The model should accept a single float input (time in seconds) and return three float values representing hue, saturation, and value adjustments.
